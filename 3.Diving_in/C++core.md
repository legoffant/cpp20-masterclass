# C++ Core langage VS Standard Library VS STL

* Core langage
* Standard Library
* STL

The Standard library is part of the language. To express the subset of the language that concerns only with the rules of the syntax, semantic rules, and such but not with the library, people use the term core language. For example there is a working group called "core working group" (CWG) and "library working group" (LWG) in the C++ committee.

As an more authoritative example Stephan T. Lavavej (STL) is a key C++ developer at Microsoft. In his lecture series about the Core Language he defines it to be anything you have access to without including any header.

The C++ standard does not mention **Core Language**, but the standard library is

* 17 Library introduction
* 18 Language support library
* 19 Diagnostics library
* 20 General utilities library
* 21 Strings library
* 22 Localization library
* 23 Containers library
* 24 Iterators library
* 25 Algorithms library
* 26 Numerics library
* 27 Input/output library
* 28 Regular expressions library
* 29 Atomic operations library
* 30 Thread support library

The *Standard Template Library*, or **STL**, is a C++ library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators; it provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science. The STL is a generic library, meaning that its components are heavily parameterized: almost every component in the STL is a template. You should make sure that you understand how templates work in C++ before you use the STL.
